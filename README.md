Hi 👋 My name is Carlos Trujillo
================================

Full Stack Engineer
-------------------

My name is Carlos and I work as a Full Stack Engineer for Wink News. I enjoy solving problems; writing code and managing Linux containers is just a fun way to channel it. I have a Bachelor's in Automation Engineering, and my motto is "It can always be better." I love a good challenge, especially those that scratch the back of your head even when you're away from the keyboard. I spend my free time playing soccer, reading, and enjoying music.
