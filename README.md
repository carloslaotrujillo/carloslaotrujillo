================================

## Fullstack Developer

I am a fullstack JavaScript/Node.js developer with over 5 years of commercial development and freelancing. My main tech stack is React for frontend and Express (Node.js) for backend. I had lead experience and managed a team of five people on a daily basis. I quickly adapt to new projects, and I always try to deeply understand development and business logic of the project.
