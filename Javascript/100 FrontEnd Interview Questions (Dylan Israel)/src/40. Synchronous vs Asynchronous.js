// In synchronous operations tasks are performed one at a time and only when one is completed, the following is unblocked. In other words, you need to wait for a task to finish to move to the next one.

// In asynchronous operations, on the other hand, you can move to another task before the previous one finishes. This way, with asynchronous programming youâ€™re able to deal with multiple requests simultaneously, thus completing more tasks in a much shorter period of time.
