JS Data Types

=> Primitives
    - Boolean (Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false.)

    - Null (Empty value user assigned. The Null type has exactly one value: null.)

    - Undefined (A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined.)

    - Number (The Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value (numbers between -(2^53 − 1) and 2^53 − 1). In addition to representing floating-point numbers, the number type has three symbolic values: +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN ("Not a Number"). To check for the largest available value or smallest available value within ±Infinity, you can use the constants Number.MAX_VALUE or Number.MIN_VALUE.)

    - BigInt (The BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for Numbers.)

    - String (Used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values. Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements in it. Unlike some programming languages (such as C), JavaScript strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it.)

    - Symbol (A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property. In some programming languages, Symbols are called "atoms".)

=> Objects (Complex data type that allows you to store collections of data. An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.)

Not Data Type

    - Arrays (Type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays.)

    - Function (Callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables)

    - Maps (The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.)

    - Sets (Set objects are collections of values. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection.)
