//  undeclared => variable does not exist

//  undefined => The value undefined means value is not assigned & you donâ€™t know its value. It is an unintentional absence of value. It means that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. In case of non primitives like objects or arrays it can mean lack of existence, but the object does exist in that case.

//  null => The value null indicates that you know that the field does not have a value. It is an intentional absence of value. The system does not return null, is an intentional value.
