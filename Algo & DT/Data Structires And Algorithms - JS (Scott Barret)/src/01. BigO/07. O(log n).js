// O(n) or Divide and Conquer

// Better than O(n) is the logarithm on base 2 of the input(n)

// Example

// n = 8

// log n ==> 3  (log on base 2 of 8 ==> 3)(We need 3 operations to solve the algorithm)

// Is better than O(n):
// O(n) ==> 8 (We need 8 operations to solve the algorith)
// O(log n) => 3 (We need 3 operations to solve the algorith)
